    "> Most states in the USA provide services and support to individuals with developmental disabilities (e.g., intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, autism, etc.) and their families. The agency through which the State of California serves the developmentally-disabled population is the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) ... One of the responsibilities of DDS is to allocate funds that support over 250,000 developmentally-disabled residents. A number of years ago, an allegation of discrimination was made and supported by a univariate analysis that examined average annual expenditures on consumers by ethnicity. The analysis revealed that the average annual expenditures on Hispanic consumers was approximately one-third of the average expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers. This finding was the catalyst for further investigation; subsequently, state legislators and department managers sought consulting services from a statistician.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll analyze the deidentified DDS data published with this article to answer the question: *is there evidence of ethnic or gender discrimination in allocation of DDS funds?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aside**: The JSE article focuses on what's known as [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox), an arithmetic phenomenon in which aggregate trends across multiple groups show the *opposite* of within-group trends. We won't emphasize this topic, though the data does provide a nice illustration -- if you're interested in learning more, you can follow the embedded link to the Wikipedia entry on the subject.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\log\\left(\\text{expend}_i\\right)\n",
    "    = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\left(\\text{6-12}\\right)_i + \\cdots + \\beta_5\\left(\\text{51+}\\right)_i + \\beta_6\\text{male}_i + \\beta_7\\text{hispanic}_i + \\cdots + \\beta_{13}\\text{other}_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, *all* of the explanatory variables are categorical and encoded using indicators; in this case, the linear model coefficients capture means for each group. \n",

You can review or skip the comments, depending on your level of interest in understanding the model better mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commments about parameter interpretation\n",
    "In particular, each coefficient represents a difference in means from the 'baseline' group. All indicators are zero for a white male recipient between ages 0 and 5, so this is the baseline group and:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}\\left(\\log(\\text{expend})\\;|\\; \\text{male, white, 0-5}\\right) = \\beta_1$$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Comments about the log transformation\n",
    "The response in this model is the *log* of expenditures (this gives a better model for a variety of reasons). The statistical assumption then becomes that:\n",

    "$$\\log(\\text{expend})_i \\sim N\\left(\\mathbf{x}_i'\\beta, \\sigma^2\\right)$$\n",

If $\\log(a) - \\log(b) = 0.04$, then $\\frac{a}{b} = e^{0.04} \\approx 1.041$; so the estimated expenditures (not on the log scale) differ by a factor of about 1.

It became apparaent through some of the initial visualizations that age actually had a heavvy influence, or at least correlation, with average expenditures, as older individuals often receivde more more funding. It also seemed that ethhnicity did not have the same effect. However, these plots were just estimates, so we performed Multiple Linear Regression to investigate these relationships mathematically. The model gave us the same results as our initial explorations, and it can be concluded that there was likely no discrimination on the basis of gender or ethnicity in thhe allocation of DDS funds*"
